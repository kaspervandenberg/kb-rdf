;;;; trie/nodes

;;;; There are Tries with different properties: Immutable-Trie, CTrie, Hierarchical-*-Trie
;;;; These tries are composed from different types of nodes.  Trie-nodes.lisp defines the node
;;;; classes for the Tries.

;;;; Names for the nodes come from Aleksandar Prokopec "Cache-Aware Lock-Free Concurrent Hash Tries",
;;;; Prokopec's CTrie will be one of the center Trie's implelemented.
