Returns three values: the value in the SNode identified by `key` or nil, a truty value indicating
whether the key was found, and the path to the root."))

Returns two values: a list of key-value pairs, and a list containing all the paths of all the nodes."))

   "Add `key`-`value` to the Trie.

Return three values: the possibly changed node that contains `key`-`value`; an action that the
parent node should execute if `add-intern` returned a node not `eq` to the parent's child; and, the
path to the root"))

Creates an empty CNode, use `add-intern` to add values to it.")
