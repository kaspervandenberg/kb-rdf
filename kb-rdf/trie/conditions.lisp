   "Trying to derive a `sub-key` and `bucket-index` without enough `hash-bits` left.

A `Key`'s `hash` has a limmited number of bits; i.e. `cl:sxhash` (in sbcl)
generates hashes of 61 (or sometimes 29) bits.  The maximum depth depends on
`bucket-size`.  Normally, a `no-hash-bits-left` condition is only signalled when
two different keys have a hash collision."))
